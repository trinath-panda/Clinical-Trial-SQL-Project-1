# Clinical-Trial-SQL-Project-1
This is my first SQL project. I used a dummy clinical trial dataset. Here I have started by learning: To design a database, Create a table, Add data to the table, Update the column name, Alter the data in the table, Define the questions that need to be answered, Clean the dataset, and Perform Exploratory Data analysis

# Tutorial

This project is for study purposes, and all the data shown and used is dummy. You can also use this for practice and educational purposes.
