# Clinical-Trial-SQL-Project-1
This is my first SQL project. I used dummy clinical trial dataset. Here I have started from the start by learning: Designing a database, Creating table, Adding data to the table, Updating the column name, Altering the data in the table, Defining the questions that is needed to answer, Cleaning the dataset and Performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
