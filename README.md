# Clinical-Trial-SQL-Project-1
This is my first SQL project. I used a dummy clinical trial dataset. Here I have started from the beginning by learning: Designing a database, Creating a table, Adding data to the table, Updating the column name, Altering the data in the table, Defining the questions that are needed to be answered, Cleaning the dataset, and Performing Exploratory Data analysis
# Tutorial

This project is for study purposes, and all the data shown and used is dummy data. You can also use this for practice and educational purposes.
# Tool Used
1. Microsoft SQL server
2. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
** You can use any SQL platform to perform your project; this is a personal preference.
